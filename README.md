## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use `background-image`:

```css
.testimonial:nth-child(1) {
    background-image: url("./images/bg-pattern-quotation.svg");
    background-position: top 0px right 2em;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

### Continued development

I still need to practice the positioning an element & `@media`. I need to practice CSS Grid & Flexbox to create desired layout. I also need to learn about responsive CSS in general & HTML5 rules.

### Useful resources

- [Grid by Example](https://gridbyexample.com/) - This helped me in learning CSS Grid.
- [Grid Garden](https://codepip.com/games/grid-garden/) - This was a fun game to practice grid fundamentals.

I got the idea of using flexbox for mobile view & grid for desktop view from this [user](https://github.com/newspaceracer).
